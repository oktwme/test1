      📋 **Guidelines:**

      - Search through [existing issues](https://github.com/BennyExtreme/KBotExt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) first to ensure that this feature has not been requested before.
      - Write a descriptive title for your issue. Avoid generic or vague titles such as "Some suggestions" or "Ideas for improvement".
      - Keep your issue focused on one single problem. If you have multiple feature requests, please create separate issues for each of them.
      - Provide as much context as possible in the details section. Include screenshots, screen recordings, links, references, or anything else you may consider relevant.
